# vnc-write-api

🌍 *[English](README.md) ∙ [Português](README_pt.md)*

`vnc-write-api` is the repository responsible for coordinating data modifications in the [Você na Câmara (VNC)](#você-na-câmara-vnc)
platform databases. In this repository you will find the source code of the VNC Write API and also the container
responsible for executing this code, so you can easily run the project.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

To run this code you will need to fill in some fields of the `.env` file present in the _config_ directory
(`./src/api/config/.env`). In this file you can see that some fields are already filled, this is because they are
default configurations that can be used if you choose not to modify any of the pre-configured containers to run the
repositories that make up the VNC,  however feel free to modify any of these variables to make the project adapt to your
environment. Also note that some of these variables are not filled in, this is because these variables have their use
linked to each user's account on platforms external to VNC and therefore must have their values generated by each user
who wants to use the platforms. These keys are:
* `CHAT_GPT_KEY` → To fill in this variable an [API key must be created in ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), 
the AI service currently used by VNC.
* `UNI_CLOUD_KEY` → To fill in this variable an [API key must be created in UniCLOUD](https://cloud.unidoc.io/#/api-keys),
the PDF manipulation service currently used by VNC.

> Note that to properly run `vnc-write-api` you will need to have the [`vnc-databases` containers](https://github.com/devlucassantos/vnc-databases)
running so that this application's container has access to the databases necessary to query and modify the data.

### Running via Docker

To run the API you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine and run the following
commands in the root directory of this project:

````shell
docker compose up
````

### Documentation
